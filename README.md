## General info
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning model developed for parking lot detection and segmentation from aerial images at a 40 cm spatial resolution. The project focuses on analyzing parking lots in the city of Würzburg, using high-resolution aerial imagery. Accurate detection of parking lots is crucial for urban planning and environmental management, as excessive parking space contributes to soil sealing—the covering of natural land with impervious surfaces like asphalt, which prevents water absorption, disrupts ecosystems, and exacerbates urban heat islands. Monitoring parking infrastructure can support sustainable urban development by identifying areas for green space reclamation or optimizing land use. This work was conducted as part of the course module "Advanced Deep Learning".
